                    </a>{" "}
                    on homeownership rates among millennials. They found that homeownership appears to be a
                    trait that can be passed from one generation to another. According to the research, young
                    adults whose parents own their homes are significantly more likely to own a home than their
                    peers whose parents are renters. Only 14.4% of millennials whose parents rent their homes
                    become homeowners, but 31.7% of those whose parents own their homes also become homeowners.
                    That&apos;s a difference of 17 percentage points!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found that the homeownership rate for 25-34 year olds was about eight percentage
                    points lower than that of Gen X and Baby boomers when they were the same age. This lower
                    rate of home ownership was attributed to a number of factors: increased education debt,
                    delayed marriage and childbearing, increased rent, and even greater racial diversity among
                    millenials.

                  <p className="mb-5">
                    Interestingly, the study discovered another factor that affected millennial homeownership
                    rates. This one, too, has to do with the parents of millenials.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The study found that as parents&apos; net worth increased, so did the likelihood that their
                    children would own a home. The graph below shows the correlation between a parent&apos;s
                    wealth and a millennial&apos;s likelihood to own a home.

                    For most Americans, a house is probably the single largest purchase they will make in their
                    lifetime. If the findings from the Urban Institute are accurate, parents who decide to
                    invest in a home are doing more than simply building up a future inheritance. They are
                    passing on a greater likelihood that their children will build wealth for themselves.
