                Prepayment penalties are at the borrower&apos;s option and are never mandatory requirements by
                the lender. Generally, prepayment penalties disappear after five years. The penalty is a
                percentage of the outstanding loan balance or it can be equal to a specific number of months
                of interest. If you want to pay 20% of your loan balance, there is no prepayment penalty for
                most loans.
              </p>

              <p className="text-[#3a4a3a] text-[16px] leading-[1.8] mb-10">
                A prepayment penalty may lower your interest rate by a &frac14;%. There are prepayment
                penalty options that apply to home purchase loans and prepayment penalty options that apply to
                refinance loans. Typically, borrowers with good credit don&apos;t have to worry about choosing
                a loan with prepayment penalties on purchase loans or refinance loans because they get more
                favorable interest rates to begin with because of their better credit scores and favorable
                payment histories.

                    What to Know About Prepayment Penalties
                  </h2>
                  <p className="mb-5">
                    If you do opt for an Arizona mortgage with a prepayment penalty, try and negotiate a
                    prepayment period for no longer than five months, the ability to make a partial prepayment
                    up to 20% of your loan balance at any time and that the prepayment penalty only applies if
                    you refinance your home. If you have plans on staying in your home for more than five
                    years, a prepayment penalty may not make a difference.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-5">
                    You should weigh all your options first before making a decision to obtain a mortgage with
                    a prepayment penalty by comparing mortgage products without a prepayment penalty. Lenders
                    must disclose to borrowers that their loan contains a prepayment penalty or face fines or
                    penalties for violating lending and disclosure laws. The problem is many borrowers
                    don&apos;t pay attention or read their loan documents carefully and discover too late when
                    they want to sell their home or refinance, that their Arizona mortgage contains a
                    prepayment penalty clause.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The best way to way to avoid any surprises about your loan terms is to read them carefully
                    first. Have your Arizona mortgage broker go over the terms with you before signing
                    anything, or hire an attorney to review your loan documents to make sure you understand
                    clearly what you are signing and your obligations, rights and responsibilities regarding
                    your credit obligation.
